        FROM world
        WHERE population > 200000000

    4. Show the name and population in millions for the countries
    of the continent 'South America'. Divide the total population
    by 1000000 to get population in millions.

    A.

        FROM world
        WHERE continent='South America'

    Q. Show the countries that are big by area or big by population.
    Show name, population and area.

    A.(Hint: Order matters)
        SELECT name, population, area
        FROM world

    8. Exclusive OR (XOR). Show the countries that are big by area
    (more than 3 illion) or big by population (more than 250 million)

    9. Show the name and population in millions and the GDP in billions
    for the countries of the continent 'South America'. Use the ROUND
    function to show the values to two decimal places.

    Q. For South America, show population in millions and GDP in billions
    both to 2 decimal places.

    A. 
        SELECT name, ROUND(population/1000000,2), ROUND(gdp/1000000000,2)
        FROM world
        WHERE continent='South America'
