    1. The example uses a WHERE clause to show the population of
    'France'. Note that strings (pieces of text that are data) 
    should be in 'single quotes'

    Q. Modify it to show the population of Germany:
    
    A.
        SELECT population
        FROM world
        WHERE name='Germany'

    2. Checking a list: The word IN allows us to check if an item
    is in a list. The example shows the name and population for the
    countries 'Brazil', 'Russia', 'India', and 'China'

    Q. Show the name and the population for 'Sweden', 'Norway', and
    'Denmark'

    A.
        SELECT name, population
        FROM world
        WHERE name IN ('Sweden', 'Norway', 'Denmark')
    
    3. Which countries are not too small and not too big? BETWEEN 
    allows range checking (range specified is inclusive of the 
    boundary values). The example below shows countries with an 
    area of 250,000-300,000 sq.km. 

    Q. Modify it to show the country and the area for countires
    with an area between 200000 and 250000.

    A. 
        SELECT name, area
        FROM world
        WHERE area BETWEEN 200000 AND 250000
